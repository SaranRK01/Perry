# Note: This is a placeholder for extension icons
# In a real extension, you would need actual PNG icon files

# To create proper icons, you need:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
# - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

# You can create these using any image editor or online icon generator
# The icons should represent your extension's purpose (e.g., shield, government building, security badge)

# For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares as temporary icons
# The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience

# Recommended icon design:
# - Simple, recognizable symbol
# - Government/security theme (shield, badge, building)
# - High contrast colors
# - Scalable design that works at small sizes
